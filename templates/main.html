      <h2>About Car Price Prediction with Data Visualisation</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: justify;">I am working on Automotive Industry . My project Title is Car Price Prediction with Visualisation. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.Our results show that Random Forest model yield the best results . Deciding whether a used car is worth the posted price when you see listings online can be difficult. For this project, we are using the dataset on used car sales from all over India. More Than this I also analyze data through Power BI. The benefits of data analyzing and data visualization are becoming increasingly evident to business organisation around the world. Power BI is business intelegence service that is employed by many of these organisations to implement these usefull tchniques on there business data maintained in the cloud data warehouse and numerous other sourses.
          User use Power BI reports to visualiza there data and perform analysis after introducing power BI and its various Formates we can understand from the details coming from Power BI reports after embedment we can publish the reports. 
          So thats why Power BI is coleective group of an assortment of services and cloud based apps that can help organisation at all level to manage , analyze the data from different Data Sources easily with the help of very user freindly interface.
          The Data sources can be various data bases and Microsoft Excel as well. After Preprocessing It helps in making very usefull reports by providing easy to use visualization and very interactive interface.
          Here In this Project we can Analyze , visualize the data of car through "Microsoft Power BI"and Predict the price of car by using "Machine Learning Model".
        <br>
        In this Project I used Following techniques and tools -
        <ul>
             <li>Primary Azure Technology</li>
             <li>Web Development (HTML , CSS , Flask) </li>
             <li>Machine Learning </li>
             <li>Visual Studio Code</li>
             <li>Power BI For Data Analysis </li>
             <li>Azure For Deployment</li>
        </ul> 
        The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com/Arora123Vasu/Car-Price-Prediction" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">github repo</a>.
